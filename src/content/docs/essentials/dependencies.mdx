## Introduction

Initialization and injection of dependencies are fundamental aspects of an application.
The approach chosen essentially determines the architectural decisions and affects
all areas of development, including testing, debugging, and design.

### Idea

There are numerous ways to initialize dependencies in Flutter.
The typical approaches employed by the Flutter community include:

- Provider package
- Riverpod package
- GetIt package (Service Locator)

I believe that all of these approaches are detrimental to the project
in the long run and I wanted to implement a solution that is predictable,
maintainable, testable, with a low learning curve and boilerplate.

I ended up with a solution based on the following ideas:

- Constructor dependency injection
- Dependency Container

### Constructor Dependency Injection

```dart
class UserRepository {
    final UserDao _userDao;

    UserRepository(this._userDao);
}
```

Constructor dependency injection is a technique for managing dependencies
in software development. It involves injecting dependencies into
a class via its constructor. This makes it very easy to see which dependencies
are required to create an instance of the class.

In contrast to the well-known service locator pattern, constructor dependency
injection does not hide the dependencies of the module. This is immensely helpful
when writing tests for your module, as it allows you to directly mock the dependencies.

Moreover, constructor dependency injection likely results in a more modular
design of your application. This is because you are forced to think about the
dependencies of your module and the separation of concerns.

### Dependency Container

```dart
abstract class Dependencies {
    abstract final Database database;
    abstract final UserRepository userRepository;
    abstract final ThemeRepository themeRepository;

    /// Convert mutable dependencies to immutable.
    Dependencies freeze();
}
```

A dependency container is a class that contains all the dependencies of an application.
It is a single source of truth for all the dependencies, which makes it easy to
manage and troubleshoot them.

## Dependencies Initialization

In terms of Sizzle Starter, process of `dependencies initialization` refers to
the process of filling the `Dependencies` with the dependencies and
returning the instance.

**Sizzle Starter** comes with a predefined approach for these purposes.
There are two main components: InitializationProcessor, InitializationSteps.

### Initialization steps

Initialization steps are the building blocks of the initialization process.
The step is just an entry in a map where key is a unique identifier of the step
and value is a function contains logic that should be executed.
Ideally, each step is responsible for initializing a single dependency.

```dart
mixin InitializationSteps {
    final initializationSteps = <String, InitializationStep>{
        'Database': (progress) {
            final database = await openDatabase(...);

            progress.dependencies.database = database;
        }
        'AuthRepository': (progress) {
            final authDao = AuthDao(progress.dependencies.database);
            final authRepository = AuthRepository(authDao);

            progress.dependencies.authRepository = authRepository;
        },
    };
}
```

### Initialization processor

Steps are being executed by the `InitializationProcessor` in a row, so
the order of the steps is important and step may use the result
of previous ones.

It works by executing the steps one by one and passing the `InitializationProgress`
object to each step. This object contains the current state of the
initialization process.

### Dependencies Scope

The `InitializationProcessor` returns the initialized result
(basically instance of `Dependencies`). At this moment,
it is needed to somehow make this container available to consumers.
For example, we need `LocaleRepository` to initialize the `LocaleBloc`.

The solution is to use the `DependenciesScope` class. It is a simple
inherited widget that contains the `Dependencies` instance and
provides it to down the elements tree.

When, you want to access the dependencies, you just need to use the
`DependenciesScope.of(context)` method and pass the dependencies to the
constructor of the class adhering to the Constructor Dependency Injection
principle.
