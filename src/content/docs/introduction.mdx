## Problem

Every programmer has a habit of writing the same code for each new task and has
a collection of libraries and tools that they utilise for every project.
Organising the layout and architecture of a new project takes up lots of time,
is dreary, and can result in errors. Several days can swiftly be consumed.

### Solution

So, I decided to make a template that covers the most common needs of a of a
flutter developer. I also aimed to create a template that is well documented
and effortless to comprehend. I trust that Sizzle Starter will help you
save considerable time.

The aim of this project is not only to gather the most desirable libraries,
but also to establish appropriate concepts for the project's structure and architecture.

The Sizzle Starter comes with:

- 🎨 ThemeScope that manages the theme: light, dark, system or custom
- 🌐 LocalizationScope that manages the localization
- 🚀 Well-defined initialization process
- 🧰 Dependency Injection
- 🏗️ Guide to the project structure and architecture
- 🤖 CI/CD configuration for GitHub Actions
- 🌐 Package for unified network requests
- 🗄️ Package for local database management using Drift
- 📱 Examples of full-blown applications built with Sizzle Starter

Each topic is covered in a separate guide. You can find the list of guides in
the sidebar.
